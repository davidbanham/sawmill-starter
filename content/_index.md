content = "The Club is a non-commercial private  sports club with a history dating back to 1951 when it was founded by a  group of enthusiastic Canberra skiers. Membership now comes from the  Canberra region and all parts of NSW. The Club enables members to pursue  mountain sports activities and provides friendly, affordable, quality  accommodation, supported by good governance, and sustainable  environmental practices. Until 1997 the Club was called the YMCA Ski  Club of Canberra.\n\nThe Club has three modern, comfortable lodges with mostly double/twin  rooms with ensuites. It currently operates two lodges in Guthega –  Tiobunga (a new lodge opened in 2008) and Kyilla and one lodge in  Thredbo – Waragun (a new lodge opened in 2004).\n\nThe Brindabella Ski Club has a special character. It is a volunteer  based not-for-profit association whose members are enthusiastic people  sharing a love of alpine sports across a variety of disciplines and who  give freely of their time and resources to maintain and develop all  aspects of the Club. The Club has about 800 members covering all ages.  Entry to the Club is restricted by numbers and assessed on the basis of a  willingness to participate in, and contribute to the Club and alpine  sports.\n\nAs one of the oldest ski clubs in Australia, with new lodges in two  premier ski resorts, and enthusiastic and committed members, the future  of the Brindabella Ski Club has never looked better."
